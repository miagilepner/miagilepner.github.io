# Hi there, 

I'm a senor software developer at a company called Stream where I get to write Go and work on distributed systems. I live in the Netherlands, though I'm originally from the US. 

When I'm not working I like to watch movies, eat, and struggle through crossword puzzles. 

Hopefully, I'll use this website's blog to share technical analyses of my projects as well as provide commentary on the tech industry and its culture.
