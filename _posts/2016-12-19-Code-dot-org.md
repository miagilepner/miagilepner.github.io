A year and a half ago, I got the incredible opportunity to shoot a Code.org video. A couple months later, the video was published and watched by thousands. 

If you're not familiar, Code.org is an organization that works to increase computer science education:

> Code.orgÂ® is a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities. Our vision is that every student in every school should have the opportunity to learn computer science, just like biology, chemistry or algebra.
